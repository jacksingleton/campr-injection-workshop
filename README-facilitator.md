## Presentation
The slides are html/js built using reveal.js

```open presentation/index.html``` on mac

For presentation mode and speaker notes: press ```s``` after opening. Will open in a seperate browser window

Use right and left arrow keys to navigate forward and backwards

```esc``` will bring up a side overview

## Hands on sections
Hands on sections increase participation but add a lot of extra time. Tweak the presentation to fit your needs.
* Slide #6 (Black box sql injection exercise) is optional
* Slides 9 and 10 are hands on and hands off options, respectively. Pick one

## Edit $IP placeholder
If you are doing slide #6, edit the '$IP' placeholder in ```presentation/index.html```
This should be your local network ip address, check that you can communicate to it from another local computer

## Print / Export PDF
Open ```presentation/index.html``` in Chrome with the ```print-pdf``` query parameter
For example: ```file:///injection-workshop/presentation/index.html?print-pdf```
Open the print dialog and either select a printer or export to PDF

## Black box hands on exercise (slide #6)
* everyone will need to be on the same network
* the network must allow computers to communicate to each other via tcp (check this!)
* package application: ```mvn -DskipTests clean package```
* install ```ncat``` and start application on your machine (you must have ```ncat```, not bsd or gnu ```nc```)
* ```ncat -lktc 'java -jar target/injection-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar' $IP 8888``` (substitute $IP for your local ip address)

## Black box demo (slide #7)
* package application: ```mvn -DskipTests clean package```
* run the app locally with: java -jar target/injection-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* print first last name in the database: ```' or 1=1 --comment'```
* enumerate all last names:
* ```for i in $(seq 0 10); do echo "' or 1=1 offset $i rows --comment" | java -jar target/injection-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar; done```

## Fixing the code (slides 9/10)
The problem is sql substitution via concatination in ```UserRepo.java:findLastName```
Prepared Statements should be used as in ```addNames```
